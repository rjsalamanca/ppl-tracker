# PPL_Tracker

PPL is short for Push Pull Legs. This project was created to be a personal tracker for my Push Pull Legs workout cycle. As I've been working on this tracker, I've added features that turned in into a full on workout tracker. You're able to create multiple workout routines and you're able to do multiple workouts per day.
